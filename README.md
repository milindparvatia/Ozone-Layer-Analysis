# Ozone-Layer-Analysis
Time series analysis of Ozone Layer and forcasting, ARIMA model creation...

I have worked on few model for time series objects and try to find best possible fitting model for it.

I found quadratic models works really well with this data and gave around 73.93% in R^2.

I have also developed few ARIMA models which can be consider for further detailed analysis.
